Give this a shot: 

- Add locations (in shadow)
- And then search for them within a radius.


Personal updates/changes:

Minor UI adjustments, syntax amends, fixed tutorial bug with display markers not visable and made a search table with google searchable urls mainly for functionality purposes. 

You will need to signup for Google Map API and put that API key in the settings.json file for the map to refresh and display layers correctly.
